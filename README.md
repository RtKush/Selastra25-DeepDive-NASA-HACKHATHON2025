## 🚀 Project Overview

**Deep Dive** is an **interactive web platform** that turns **NASA’s open datasets** into immersive **3D experiences** using **WebXR**, **React**, and **Three.js**.

Instead of looking at static charts, users **explore oceans, skies, and space** through real NASA data — directly from their browser, no VR headset required.

> 🎯 “From numbers to narratives — turning NASA’s data into living experiences.”

## 🌍 Problem Statement

NASA collects a **massive amount of satellite data** every day from missions like:

- 🛰 **PACE** – *Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem Mission*  
- 🌊 **SWOT** – *Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission*  
- 🌎 **GRACE-FO** – *Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On*

🔹 The problem:  
- The data is **too complex** for most people.  
- It’s hidden in **spreadsheets, graphs, or APIs**.  
- The **emotional story** behind the data gets lost.

> 🧩 In short: **NASA has the data — but the story is missing.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built **Deep Dive Hub**, a **VR-ready storytelling platform** that transforms NASA’s data into **interactive, visual, and emotional stories**.

Users can experience **oceans, planets, and asteroids** like never before — visually, emotionally, and interactively.

> 🌐 “Data exists, but stories make it human.”

## 🌊 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🌊 **Ocean Exploration (PACE Mission)** | Visualizes ocean color, plankton, and clouds as living oceans — not static charts. |
| 🌞 **Solar System Explorer** | Explore planets, moons, and asteroids in 3D space with real eclipse simulations and atmospheric soundscapes. |
| ☄️ **Near-Earth Object Tracker** | Displays real NASA asteroid data with orbit paths and approach info. |
| 🎮 **Interactive Learning Modules** | Quizzes, challenges, and missions that make science exploration fun. |
| 🎧 **Immersive Storytelling + AI Chatbot** | Voice narration, spatial audio, and AI explanations simplify complex data for all. |

## 🧠 Technology Stack

| Part | Technology | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 🌐 **Frontend** | React + Three.js | Builds the 3D interactive environment |
| 🎞 **Animation** | GSAP 3 (GreenSock Animation Platform) | Creates cinematic animations and transitions |
| ⚙️ **Backend** | Node.js + Express | Fetches, processes, and serves NASA’s datasets |
| 🧩 **Accessibility** | AI Chatbot | Converts scientific data into simple, human-friendly language |
| 🕶 **Cross-Platform** | WebXR + 360° | Works seamlessly on desktop, mobile, and VR |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **NASA Data Integration** → Fetch real datasets from missions like PACE, SWOT, GRACE-FO.  
2. **Data Processing** → Clean, filter, and map readings into visual layers.  
3. **3D Visualization** → Render realistic oceans, skies, and celestial bodies using Three.js.  
4. **User Interaction** → Explore, play, and learn through guided immersive stories.  
5. **Impact** → Builds awareness and emotional connection to climate and Earth science.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- 🌍 **Makes science human** — transforms raw data into experiences.  
- 💙 **Raises awareness** about climate and ocean systems.  
- 👩‍🏫 **Engages students** through interactive learning.  
- 🧭 **Bridges the gap** between knowledge and understanding.

> “We can’t protect what we don’t understand — Deep Dive helps everyone understand Earth.”
